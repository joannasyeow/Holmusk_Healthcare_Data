# Assessing key cost drivers associated with inpatient admission of patients with condition X

The goal of this challenge is to identify key cost drivers associated with inpatient admission of patients of a certain condition.
(Let's call it condition X)

There are a total of 1 presentation slide, 2 SQL codes and 3 notebooks for this project :
1. [slides.keynote] / [slides.pptx]
2. [SQL.SQL](xx)
3. [SQL_PT_2.SQL](xx)
4. [EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)](xx)
5. [Patient Level](https://github.com/joannasys/Kaggle---Credit/blob/master/3_Data%20Preprocessing.ipynb)
6. [Admission Level (WIP)](https://github.com/joannasys/Kaggle---Credit/blob/master/4_Data%20Modeling.ipynb)

## Load into Database & Data Cleaning
The dataset is imported into my local postgres SQL database in it's original form. I used SQL to do most of the data cleaning and created some new variables. You may refer to sql.sql (EDA notebook) and sql_pt_2.sql (Patient Level notebook) for the code.
